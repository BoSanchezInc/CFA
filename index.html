<h2 align="center">10 Core Principles That Will
  Dramatically Change Your Child’s Life—
  And Your Life As Well.</h2>
    <div data-role="collapsible-set">
      <div data-role="collapsible">
        <h3>Follow Your Child’s Passions</h3>
<p>One of my son’s first words was “Horse”.<br />
<em>            </em>I’m not kidding.<br />
<em>            </em>It was spoken together with “Mama” and “Mamam” (food or water).<br />
<em>            </em>As a toddler, he already loved playing with plastic toy horses, riding his wooden rocking horse, and looking at pictures of all sorts of horses.<br />
So we gave him large books on horses, and he gobbled them up and kept asking for more.  Together, we studied the different breeds from around the world, the evolution of the horse, the equipment needed to ride horses, etc.  We bought him coloring books with lots and lots of horses.  At three years old, he was already riding real horses by himself.  Today, he dreams of owning a ranch where he’ll own ten horses—as a business!  He said he’d let the kids ride on the horses for a fee.  His ranch will also have a restaurant, a “fake” jungle with robotic animals, and a man-made lake with a shipwreck as added attractions.<br />
<em>            </em>Because of his passion for horses, he learned the following: To read a lot, do artwork (coloring), study science (horse anatomy), history and culture, physical education, and even business.<br />
<em>            </em>Yes, he studied all those subjects—just because of his love for horses.<br />
<em>            </em>No forcing.  No pushing.  No intimidating.  No stress!<br />
<em>            </em>Because it was his passion, he <em>loved </em>to learn.<br />
<em>            </em>That, my friends, is one of the best secrets of homeschool.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>What Is Your Child’s Passion?</strong><br />
<strong>It May Not Be Obvious At First,<br />
But It’s Got History, Science, Math, &amp; Art In There&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p>Is your child a comic book lover?<br />
<em>            </em>Encourage him.  That requires reading, too!<br />
<em>            </em>Research together on comic book authors, illustrators, and companies.  Sign him up for drawing classes.  Tell him to rent out his comics for a fee.  And through the Internet, find out which comic books sell for thousands of dollars today.  Let him draw one and sell it to relatives.  Do the math for his small businesses.<br />
<em>            </em>Is he a basketball fan?  Then read about the history of basketball, go through basketball statistics, study which muscle groups need to be highly developed in basketball, create artwork on basketball players, play ball regularly, and watch some games together.<br />
When my son was four, we started playing <em>Cashflow For Kids, </em>a game where players buy real estate and invest in stocks.  We found out that aside from financial knowledge, it’s a great way for our son to learn mental math.  We also played his<em>Pokemon </em>cards—and his math has improved because of the constant adding and subtracting in the game.<br />
<em>            </em>We recommend more “real” books—like biographies, classic tales, and special interest books.  In fact, we recommend “living” books, like interviewing experts instead of just reading facts.<br />
<em>            </em>Again, this cannot happen in a traditional school.<br />
There are programmed topics to discuss for every week—and the entire class has to go through them.   And thus, boredom sets in.  Not because they’re dumb, but simply because their passions aren’t pursued.<br />
<em>            </em>In homeschool, you use <em>anything </em>that he’s interested in to learn all sorts of subjects.  Because when he’s interested about something, you simply “ride the horse” of his passion, and off you go at 100 kph.<br />
And not only the child’s passion, but you also follow something very important in your child…</p>        
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Follow Your Child’s Learning Style</h3>
<p>Your child is a genius.<br />
<em>            </em>You just have to know what <em>kind </em>of genius.<br />
<em>            </em>Let me give you a very simple example of what I mean by following your child’s learning style.<br />
<em>            </em>When my son, Bene, was five years old, he was having problems with his math exercises.  It would take him ages to write down his answers.  Bene would get totally bored, and we’d catch him stalling and dillydallying in the middle of the writing exercise.  His thoughts would wander, sometimes creating a full-length movie in his mind.  (We know because we hear him whispering, “Bangbangbang!  Shooooosh!  Vabooooooom!”)<br />
It would happen every time and my wife would be totally frustrated.<br />
<em>            </em>After many weeks of tension-filled homeschool sessions (“Son, finish that now!  I said NOW!”), my wife was wondering if math was his waterloo.  Did he really hate math?<br />
And then an idea struck her.  She picked up the workbook, and she verbally asked the questions—and made it like a game.  Bene would stand at the far end of our living room and he’d take one step for every right answer.<br />
<em>            </em>Guess what: He breezed through it.<br />
<em>            </em>At least at that particular stage in his life (five years old), oral and mental math was better than written math.<br />
<em>            </em>Do you now see how only homeschool can make that kind of adjustment?<br />
Because the mother is teaching her child one-to-one, she can change teaching methods depending on the learning style of her child.<br />
<em>            </em>Let me tell you what usually happens in a traditional school.  Whenever a student is doing well in school, the school proudly points to themselves and say, “We’re the reason why your child is performing well.  <em>We’re good.”</em>  But when a student is failing, the school points to the child and says, “Tsk, tsk, tsk.  There’s something wrong with your kid<em>.”</em><br />
<em>            </em>Okay, they may not say it in that way.  But when the child is failing (or bored or restless or uncooperative), it’s always the child’s fault.  You’ll hear the experts say, “Your boy isn’t learning because he’s stubborn and has undiagnosed ADHD and probably has a slight form of dyslexia.”<br />
<em>            Sure</em>.  Gosh, why is the kid always at fault?</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Remember This Powerful Rule: </strong><br />
<strong>If The Child Isn’t Learning, </strong><br />
<strong>It’s 99% Not The Child’s Fault.  </strong><br />
<strong>Instead, Change Your Teaching Method!</strong></h2>
<p>In homeschool, we believe that if the child isn’t learning, it’s not his fault 99% of the time.  Perhaps the parent isn’t using the specific learning style of her child.<br />
There are three basic learning styles (auditory, visual, and kinesthetic) with as much as 27 (!) subgroups.  None is better than the other.  You simply need to discover how your child processes information—and then deliberately use his preferred choice.<br />
By simply observing how he learns best will already give you clues as to the genius of your child.  There’s nothing better than following this simple rule of thumb: <em>Do what works!</em><br />
<em>            </em>Some kids prefer structure and like being told what to do (that’s why there’s room for the structured, traditional school system done at home), while other kids like to do things on their own.<br />
And some learn more in particular environments and at particular times of the day—so adjust accordingly.   Believe me, this is much better than scolding, shouting, and bullying our kids to fit <em>our </em>teaching methods.<br />
<em>            </em>And if you think that this is a powerful principle, wait till you read the next one…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>        
        
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Follow your Child’s Learning Pace Per Subject</h3>
<p>A traditional classroom with 40 kids has one established pace of learning.<br />
Usually, they try to go mid-speed—not too fast, and not too slow.<br />
<em>            </em>Sometimes, this learning pace is too slow for your child—resulting in boredom.  (I know many children who are failing in school, not because they’re dumb, but because of the opposite reason—they’re actually too bright and are totally bored by class.)  On a few occasions, the pace may be too fast—and your child is left behind.<br />
<em>            </em>Here’s something else you’ve got to think about.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your child has different speeds per subject.</span>  Your child may go at 80 kph in English and only 40 kph in Math.<br />
<em>            </em>In homeschooling, you can simply adjust with his pace<em>for each subject.</em><br />
<em>            </em>Here’s the rule: When you see him bored, usually it’s because he already knows the material.  Try going faster and introduce new material.<br />
<em>            </em>For example, if your child is totally bored by his Grade 3 English, what’s stopping you from zooming ahead and tackling Grade 4 English?<br />
<em>            </em>When my son was five years old, I remember bringing him to the doctor’s clinic, and while in the waiting room, Bene would sit and quietly read his books.  And every time, people around would be shocked seeing this little guy reading <em>Charlotte’s Web, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, </em>and<em> James And The Giant Peach</em>—stuff usually read at Grade 3 levels.<br />
<em>            </em>I believe we underestimate our kids.  If you follow your child’s pace, you may be surprised at his speed of learning.<br />
<em>            </em>On the other hand, there’s no point in rushing a child to read (or write or do math) when he’s not yet ready.  Tests have proven that kids who learned to finally read well as late as age 10 onwards <em>do catch up very quickly—</em>and surpass the early readers from regular schools.Again, don’t pressure yourself or your child!<br />
<em>            </em>I believe that you should avoid giving “study pressures” until kids are age 8 to 12.  If you follow their passion and learning pace, you don’t need pressure.<br />
<em>            </em>And one more thing about pressure…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>        
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Never Use Fear & Punishments As Motivation</h3>
<p>This mystified me.<br />
<em>            </em>I learned that the expert animal trainers of dogs, birds, lions, tigers, seals, cats, and even dolphins have very important basic rules: Never insult the animal; and never offend the animal; and never hurt the animal.  Or the animal doesn’t learn.<br />
<em>            </em>But John Holt says that we forget this rule when it comes to training human beings!  I agree with him.  How many times have I heard parents and teachers (and aunts and uncles and grandfathers and grandmothers) insult their own little children?  We scream at them, we call them names, we bully them, we intimidate them, we make them cower in fear—just so they do what we want them to do.<br />
<em>            </em>Here’s a rule: The moment the teacher is shouting in anger, <em>true</em> learning stops.<br />
You can use angry shouting for emergencies, but you don&#8217;t use it in education.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>True Learning Means Having Fun.</strong><br />
<strong>If It’s Not Fun, Do Something About It!</strong></h2>
<p>In homeschooling, true learning has to be fun and exciting for your child.<br />
If it isn’t, you adjust and make it so.<br />
<em>            </em>When learning is fun, your child will go 100 kph.  But when learning is forced upon him, he’ll go at 2 kph—with lots of dillydallying and delaying tactics.<br />
<em>            </em>Banish fear and punishments from your educational system.<br />
<em>            </em>They simply don’t work.  And in homeschool, you simply drop whatever isn’t helping a child.  Why?  Because you’re not tied to one way of doing things.<br />
So if you see that your teaching method or curriculum or class schedule or textbook (It could be anything!) isn’t helping but blocking your child’s learning, drop it and try something new.  Believe me, it’s much better than forcing it down the little guy’s throat with anger, intimidation, and threats of punishment.  (Note: You can of course use reason and persuasion to convince him to read a particular book he doesn’t like to read.  That’s OK!)<br />
<em>            </em>Traditional classrooms, by their very structure, are inflexible.  Even if a student isn’t learning, the activity or book or method has to go on.  Understandably, because there are forty other students in class.<br />
<em>            </em>My next principle is probably the most controversial of all…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Use Tests And Grades As Tools For Gauging Mastery, not as Tools to Label and Terrorize your Child</h3>
<p>Traditional schools create good “test-takers”.<br />
But do they create good learners and critical thinkers and passionate kids?<br />
Tests and exams create fear, because the results of tests are used to “label” children with a grade.<br />
I repeat—<em>true</em> learning cannot happen in the presence of fear.<br />
<em>            Pseudo</em> learning, yes, and that happens quite often.<br />
Kids, under enormous pressure, memorize stuff.  And when grades are given, the kids are labeled, categorized, and branded.<br />
I ask: Why?  What for?<br />
<em>            </em>Why not just go through a series of questions, and when they make an error, teach them the right answer <em>at that moment?</em>  Why do you have to give him a zero point for not knowing the answer?<br />
<em>            </em>I really believe that we have adults now who are totally un-proactive in their lives because they have a fear of making mistakes—which they learned from school.<br />
But mistakes are important!  I’ve come to realize that the most successful people in the world are those who have made the most mistakes!<br />
<em>            </em>So in place of traditional tests, what should we do?</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Use The Child’s Desire To Tell Stories<br />
About What She Knows</strong></h2>
<p><em>            </em>There’s something even better than workbooks, fill in the blanks, multiple choices, true and false items, and a list of questions.<br />
<em>            </em>Charlotte Mason recommends that we use the power of narration.  In other words, why not ask children to tell stories?  By doing so, they don’t get bits of <em>information</em>—but real<em>knowledge</em>.  (We confuse the two.  They’re actually worlds apart.)<br />
Only when kids tell stories—either in written or oral forms—or recounting “plot” behind science, history, and religion—can you instill a genuine <em>love for knowledge.  </em>And not a fear for failure, or even a shallow desire for high grades.<br />
<em>            </em>And please: Don’t grade their narrations with an A, a C, or an F.<br />
<em>            </em>Instead, engage them in conversation.  Ask questions.  Talk some more.  Tell your child where he was excellent.  Point out where they can do better.  But most importantly, enjoy the conversation. (Note: I started a Homeschool Provider called<em>Catholic Filipino Academy </em>or CFA. It’s the first Catholic Homeschool Provider that does purely homeschool services in the Philippines. And for DepEd requirements, CFA will give quarterly tests to measure the child’s grasp of the subject matter—but without the threats, the fear, the negative competition, or the labelling usually involved in tests.)<br />
<em>            </em>Believe me, that’s when real learning happens.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Why I Don’t Agree With<br />
<em>Some </em><strong>Homeschool Systems…</strong></strong></h2>
<p><em>            </em>As I said before, I’ve noticed that <em>some </em>homeschool programs today don’t follow all these Core Principles I’m sharing to you now. I’ve seen <em>some</em> Homeschool Providers who merely transfer the “traditional school system” <em>into</em> the parent’s home. Unless this is <em>what their children want, </em>I feel this is a tragic mistake.<br />
<em>            </em>Here’s what usually happens. Because the parents want to stick to the “packaged curriculum” bought from their Homeschool Provider, they do NOT follow their child’s learning style, nor their child’s passion, nor their child’s learning pace.And because their homeschool program <span style="text-decoration: underline;">requires</span>monthly tests and grades, they again use fear and punishment as standard teaching tools to pressure their kids to pass these tests.<br />
<em>            </em>I feel this is a terrible waste of homeschool. It’s not a total loss, but I could compare it to harvesting thirty-fold when you could have harvested a hundredfold.<br />
<em>            </em>I pity the children, and I pity the parents! (I repeat: If this structured homeschool system is what your children want, then give it to them! This must be their learning style, so follow it. But if it isn’t, forcing it on them will just produce suffering on both parties.)<br />
Homeschool isn’t simply about changing the geographical location of learning—from classroom to home. Nor is it about changing the “terror” teacher and becoming the “terror” parent.<br />
<em>            </em>Homeschool is a total change of paradigm.<br />
<em>            </em>Homeschool is a radical change on how we think children <em>really</em> learn.</p>
<p>The next principle is a tough one.  But it’s crucial for the success of our kids.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Nurture A Great Love For Reading</h3>
<p>The <em>Catholic Filipino Academy’s</em> goal is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-directed </span>learning.<br />
<em>            </em>You want your child to start learning <em>on his own,</em>because of his sheer love for knowledge.  (Yes, every child has an insatiable hunger to learn.  You just have to connect to that, release that desire, and see her conquer the world.)<br />
<em>            </em>But self-directed learning can happen more easily if a child develops a love for reading as well.<br />
<em>            </em>A fair warning: Some children develop late at reading. Don’t worry!  In a few years, homeschoolers catch up quickly and surpass the reading abilities of children going to regular schools.<br />
<em>            </em>How do you nurture that in a child?</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Read To Your Child Books That Interest Them.</strong><br />
<strong>And Surround Them With Books, Books, and More Books…</strong></h2>
<p>Find out what interests a child.<br />
<em>            </em>When your child can’t read yet, set a special time each day where you read <em>to </em>them.  Ham it up.  Play act.  Put drama.  Get into the role and let your child laugh and have a great time.<br />
<em>            </em>There are four types of readers, depending on their preferred subject matter.  (No time to discuss this now, but this will be included in the <strong>Quick Start Training Program</strong> we give parents with children enrolled in CFA<em>.</em>)  Surround your child with the books on her preferred subject.  Buy, barter, and borrow—do what you must, but those books have to be there for easy reach.<br />
Tip: Get those “Series” books.  Because when your child gets hooked on one book, he’d want to read every book in the series.  (My son read 34 books of the <em>Magic Tree House </em>Series.)<br />
<em>            </em>And parents—your kids have to see you reading books as well!<br />
<em>            </em>Cut TV watching and computer games to a minimum  (we allow those on weekends only) so that there’ll be generous time for reading everyday.<br />
Reading for pleasure is so important to learning. I’m saddened at the huge amount of “homework” kids bring home from school.<br />
<em>            </em>That’s the benefit of homeschool: Class is only three to four hours a day, so your child can read books for an hour or two each day, for the sheer delight it brings.<br />
By the way, did that little fact surprise you?  That homeschool takes only three to four hours a day?  Here’s the reality: Most of the hours in a traditional school is spent on waiting: waiting for the classmates to arrive, waiting for everyone to settle down, waiting for the bell to ring…<br />
<em>            </em>In homeschool, you skip all that, so that you have more time for what I call “ordinary life events”.</p>
      </div>
      <div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
        <h3>Make Ordinary Life Events As Your Classroom</h3>
<p><em>            </em>Trust in your child.<br />
<em>            </em>She learned how to smile, crawl, walk, talk, run, dress by herself, and understand her world before starting school.<br />
<em>            </em>Because each child loves to learn.  For them, it’s as natural as breathing.<br />
Kids learn the way adults do: By their interests and by their curiosity.<br />
So why teach them in a different way?  In fact, that’s why John Holt coined the term, “Unschooling”.  Because ultimately, you don’t really “teach” your child.  (We use that word loosely.)  You merely provide the learning environment and resources so that your child <em>self-learns.</em><br />
<em>            </em>In the end, true learning and living cannot be separated.<br />
<em>            </em>There are three things that you can do to use ordinary life events as your classroom:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>1. Let Your Child Get Involved In Your Adult World</strong></p>
<p><em>            </em>Kids love to get involved in the adult world—with what<em>you’re </em>doing.<br />
<em>            </em>So get them involved!<br />
<em>            </em>Usually, your child will be passionate with what <em>you’re</em>passionate about.  Whatever your concerns are, she’ll pick that up, latch on to that, and be passionate about that too.<br />
<em>            </em>So whenever feasible, get them involved in your world. Bring them along when you work (if your work situation allows for this) and let them observe, help out, and do stuff for you—yes, even if they bother you and slow you down.<br />
<em>            </em>For example, John Holt recommends that Math be learned by opening the financial books of the family, and teaching children how the household money is earned, spent, and saved.<br />
<em>            </em>If you’re interested in business, I’ll go even further and recommend that children start their own businesses—and practice applied Math right away.  Believe me, when your child wants to know whether he can buy his favorite toy from his business profits for the month, he’ll become a math wizard right before your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>2. Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real</span> Projects Together!</strong></p>
<p align="left">            Would you be happy if you did something totally meaningless everyday?<br />
<em>            </em>But that’s what school is to many children.<br />
<em>            </em>Let’s face it: <em>Even adults hate it when we do something that has no relevance with real life.  </em>So why do we ask our kids to do it—and scold them when they get bored?<br />
<em>            </em>Here are examples of what I mean by “Real” Projects:<br />
<em>            </em>For those mechanically inclined, let your child build stuff with you for the house.  Stuff that you actually need and will actually use.<br />
<em>            </em>For children who love music, prepare a “mini-concert” for the next family get-together.  Create invitation cards with silly artwork, cook pasta together, practice your child’s welcome speech, and have a musicale complete with costumes and dance numbers.  (In one blow, you’ve had art lessons, music lessons, speech lessons, and theatre lessons.  But more importantly, you’ve built character and confidence in your child.)<br />
<em>            </em>And instead of listening to a lecture of loving the poor, volunteer to build a house in a <em>Gawad Kalinga</em> village, or help in an orphanage each month, or go to the province and work with farmers.  At the end of the day, real education isn’t information, but transformation.  And that’s what will happen if you use ordinary life events as your classroom.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>3. Finally, Don’t Program Everything.  Let Your Child <em>Be!</em></strong></p>
<p><em>            </em>Please set aside enough time for your child for his play and imagination everyday.<br />
<em>            </em>Don’t try to do what some overzealous homeschool moms do—cram a ton of activities, workbooks, games, projects, songs, and chores into their child’s life from dawn to dusk.  Not only isn’t this beneficial to your child, it will also burn you out!<br />
<em>            </em>Let your child <em>be </em>for long stretches of time everyday.<br />
<em>            </em>Without you telling them what to do!<br />
<em>            </em>Just so that he could be himself.  And think.  And read.  And ponder.  And imagine.<br />
<em>            </em>Fantasy is his way of learning how to cope with the world.<br />
<em>            </em>These times are very important for his own self-learning.<br />
<em>            </em>During these times, you’ll find out that he’s trying to figure things <em>on his own.  </em>How stuff works.  How the world works.<br />
<em>            </em>That’s a crucial part of homeschooling—<em>when you’re not around.</em></p>
<p><em>            </em>And this also includes…</p>

        <h3>Make Work And Service Essential To Your Child’s Education</h3>
<p><em>            </em>I repeat our philosophy: <em>The best way to learn is to actually do it.</em>  It beats any lecture, any book, any field trip, any counseling.<br />
<em>            </em>For example, our son has a <em>Bangus</em> business and has gained much confidence because of it.  At the age of five, he handed out flyers to our visitors at home.  He went around in his three-wheeled bicycle and delivered them to his grandmother’s house.  I asked him for suggestions when we designed that leaflet.  He also wrote down his first “prospect” list of 10 people who’d buy from him (mostly our family!).  As he grows older, we will slowly give him more and more responsibilities to his growing business.<br />
According to <em>The Moore Foundation </em>(a pioneer in Homeschooling), education should not just be (1) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Study</span>.  It should also contain equal amounts of (2) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Work</span> and (3) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service</span>—Thus forming the three basics of a good Homeschool education.<br />
<em>            </em>By <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Work</span>, we mean household chores <em>and</em>entrepreneurship.<br />
<em>            </em>Believe me, when you give your children responsibility for certain parts of the household and certain parts of a small home business—you’ll see him rapidly grow and mature before your eyes!  You solve many character and personality problems<em>spontaneously—</em>better than all your scolding, homilies, lectures, and punishments.<br />
<em>            </em>And don’t give cash for household chores.  Or you program them to become employees.  They need to produce or sell something in the business to earn something—and you program them to be entrepreneurs.<br />
<em>            </em>And what does <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service</span> mean?<br />
<em>            </em>Let your kids <em>regularly </em>serve among the poor, in an orphanage, in a soup kitchen, in a home for the elderly.  Set a<em>daily</em> schedule for service in the neighborhood if possible.  You’ll find your child growing in love, character, kindness, and integrity.  Their sense of compassion and nobility of heart will increase.<br />
<em>            </em>By the way, please remember that there’s a number 4—and that’s <em>Prayer.  </em>But it shouldn’t be separated from 1, 2, &amp; 3.  We recommend that before and after Study, Work, and Service,<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you pray with your child</span>.  And your child will realize that everything must be done with God and for God.<br />
<em>            </em>And now—for one of the most important things in your life…</p>

        <h3>Build Your Family Relationship (The Greatest Reward!)</h3>
<p><em>            </em>In homeschool, you spend each day with your child playing games, swapping stories, taking adventures, reading stories—and creating memories that will last a lifetime.<br />
<em>            </em>Yes, you bond with your child in an extraordinary way!<br />
<em>            </em>And if you have more than one child, you bond the siblings together, too.  The older children teach the younger children (and because teaching is the best way of learning, everyone benefits).<br />
<em>            </em>On a whim, my wife can bring our two children for a trip to wherever.  They can visit a sick friend or attend a birthday party.  They can go to the zoo, a museum, or a movie.</p>
<div class="cosmo-box default medium "><div class="fl"><h5> My Son Isn’t Ashamed Of Expressing Love</h5><p>My son is 20 years old today, but because we’ve bonded enough through homeschool, we could still walk in the mall holding hands. Even with his classmates and friends around, he’d greet his Daddy and me with a kiss and a hug.</p></div><div class="fr arrow green"><a href="" class="button medium rectangle blue">--Tina Galvez, Quezon City <span class="desc">Homeschooled her only son</span></a></div> </div>
<p><em>            </em>Probably the first question people will ask about homeschooling is, “<em>What about your child’s socialization?”</em><br />
<em>            </em>Here’s the answer: On average, homeschooled kids have been known to be more socially adept and more socially confident than other children.<br />
Shocked?  Here’s why: In homeschool, kids get the <em>right</em>kind of socialization.  Because you want your child to learn character, morals, and manners from <em>you, </em>and not from his peers.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Offer True Love.</strong><br />
<strong>Not Anti-Socialization</strong></h2>
<p><em>            </em>This is the most asked question to me: <em>What about your child’s socialization?</em><br />
Here’s my answer: Many times, large schools today offer our children <em>anti-socialization.</em><br />
Without meaning to do so, they open our kids to the meanness of other kids.  The bullying, the snobbishness, the peer pressure…<br />
<em>            </em>Kids don’t need that daily pressure to grow into healthy, positive kids.<br />
Let your child grow in a place where his self-worth and confidence is established.  Once that’s settled deep within, he can conquer the world.  (Sometimes, I think they can conquer any planet.)<br />
<em>            </em>Does your child need to relate with kids his own age?<br />
<em>            </em>Yes, he does.  He needs two or three of them, but not necessarily forty. Perhaps cousins and neighbors he can play with everyday. Find ways where he can compete in sports and be with other kids.</p>
<p><em>            </em>We enrolled our son in a gym class where he goes once a week.  And because of our regular prayer meetings in our Catholic Community, he gets to have many friends among the children of other members.</p>

        <h3>Personally Share Your Faith and Values With Your Child</h3>
<p><em>            </em>Today, many kids have tepid faith and weak values—and one reason for this?  Parents are no longer seriously taking their spiritual responsibility to introduce the Lord to their children.  Instead, many parents pass this spiritual responsibility onto the school.  But that doesn&#8217;t work!  How can a school do it with hundreds or thousands of kids under their administration?<br />
<em>            </em>Dearest Parent, you’re the priest in your home and one of your most important roles is to bring your child into a vibrant relationship with God.  Of course, a teacher or priest can do this—but only as an added support to you.  Ultimately, that’s your job.<br />
Faith and values aren’t taught as much as “caught”. Homeschooling is the perfect context where this “contaminating” can take place.<br />
<em>            </em>In our own Homeschool Program at CFA we wish to deepen the Catholic faith of our children. (This will be our specialty, however, children from other denominations are always welcome. After all, their parents will pass <em>their </em>faith to them.)<br />
Friend, you need to deepen <em>your own </em>Catholic faith. For how can you give what you don’t have? (If you’re not yet a member of the KERYGMA FAMILY, sign up now at <a href="http://www.kerygmafamily.com/">http://www.kerygmafamily.com/</a> and get all the resources you need to grow spiritually: Daily Bible Reflections, spiritual books, inspiring audio and video talks, etc. We give you a mountain of powerful stuff so that you keep growing in the Lord.)<br />
